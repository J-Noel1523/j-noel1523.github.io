    <br><u>Why do we name the notes the way we do?</u><br>
    
    We name the notes using the first seven letters of the alphabet A through G — A, B,<br> C, D, E, F, and G. The notes named with these basic letters are called <b>natural notes.</b>
    The other 5 remaining notes fall in between the natural notes. They are named with what are called <b>sharps</b> and <b>flats.</b> Sharps and flats indicate if a note is above or below one of the natural notes.

Learning staff and clefs are important because they are basically the 'language' of playing that instrument. 
They tell you where each note goes, and how to play them on the instrument you are trying to preform. It's important to learn these notes 
before playing an instrument, again. These notes work with the lines they are provided on, and they 
can be memorized in often acronyms (for example: FACE). Some schools even provide that these things are memorized 
in elementary or middle school, and students often get graded on them. It's important also for students who want to 
play instruments at school, or if you have a class for learning 
an instrument (etc: guitar).

￼

Why do we name the notes the way we do?
We name the notes using the first seven letters of the alphabet A through G — A, B,
C, D, E, F, and G. The notes named with these basic letters are called natural notes. The other 5 remaining notes fall in between the natural notes. They are named with what are called sharps and flats. Sharps and flats indicate if a note is above or below one of the natural notes.￼ 

These are your sharps and flats!
￼
White and Black Piano Keys
The white keys on the piano are all the natural notes - A, B, C, D, E, F, and G

In between most of the natural notes (white keys) there is a black key. The black keys are sharps and flats. You will notice that the black keys each have a name with a sharp and a name with a flat. It’s important to understand the same note can have more than one name. 

Two note names describing the very same note are said to be enharmonic.

￼
The ‘basics’ of learning an instrument (vocabulary):

Staff - a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch—or, in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments.

Clefs - a musical symbol used to indicate the pitch of written notes.

Treble Clef - A symbol indicating that the second line from the bottom of a staff represents the pitch of G above middle C. Also called G clef .

Ledger Lines - a short line added for notes above or below the range of a staff.

Bass Clef - a symbol placed on the fourth line of a staff to indicate that the fourth line of the staff corresponds to the F next below middle C; F clef. Origin of bass clef.

Grand Staff- When music on two staves is joined by a brace, or is intended to be played at once by a single performer
￼

What is an octave?

a series of eight notes occupying the interval between (and including) two notes, 
one having twice or half the frequency of vibration of the other.

￼

Staff - foundation upon which notes are drawn.

- Every modern staff contains 5 lines, 4 spaces.

- The lines or spaces on the staff represent a white key on the keyboard.
 
Treble Clef - 

G: The staff line which wraps around the clef. Any note placed on this line becomes G.

A: The note on the space above G.

B: The note on the line above A.

This process is continued.

Once you run out of room to place Treble Clefs, you use Ledger Lines.
￼
These are your most common time signatures for your beats of a note!
Sometimes, they are demonstrated by either being clapped out, or 
sounded out with each note. Can you try it?

￼
 Relative Minor-

The relative minor is a minor third down from the major, regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature. 
The key signatures with seven flats (♭) and seven sharps (♯) are rarely used because 
they have simpler enharmonic equivalents.

￼

Ledger Lines-

You can continue drawing on ledger lines, while placing treble clef letters.

￼

Bass Clef (also called the F clef)-

- Staff in between the two dots of the clef is F.
- You fill in the rest of the staff with notes.

        <br><u>Grand Staff</u>-<br>
<br>
- Consists of 11 lines.<br>
- If you eliminate the middle line, you end up with 2 normal staffs. <br>
- By adding a treble cleff to the top staff, and a bass cleff to the bottom staff, there is a relationship between the two staffs. <br>
- They are joined by the C! <br>
- The C is commonly called the ‘middle C’ since it corresponds to the middle staff line on the Grand Staff. <br>
